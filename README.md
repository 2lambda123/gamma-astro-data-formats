# Data format specs

A place to propose and share data format specifications.

## What's the goal?

* Agree on formats and try to convince people developing various codes to use them instead of inventing their own.
* Have short descriptions in this repo (one folder per format)
* Maybe: have example files
* Maybe: have linters
