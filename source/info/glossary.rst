IACT

IACT = imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (see `wikipedia article

.. _glossary-obs:

Observation = Run
+++++++++++++++++

For IACTs observations are usually conducted by pointing the array (or a
sub-array) for a period of time (typically half an hour for current IACTs)
at a fixed location in celestial coordinates (i.e. the telescopes slew in
horizontal Alt/Az coordinates to keep the pointing position RA/DEC in the
center of the field of view).

For current IACTs the term "run" is more common than "observation", but for
CTA probably the term "observation" will be used. So it's recommended to use
observation in these format specs.
